Requirements
---

Needs python 3.

This module has only been tested on Ubuntu LTS and Archlinux. At least macOS
should work out of the box though.

Install
---
Use pip or you OS's package manager to install dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

Consider using a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/#usage).

Runtime
---
Either use `PYTHONPATH=path/to/here python` or a symlink to this root to import the package.
